# Moringa School weeek 1 project
#### This is about creating my first Moringa school week 1 project which is a simple landing page for Moringa. Version 1.0.0
#### By **Victor Mmulah**
## Description
This page is supposed to improve the design of Moringa School landing page. It has the name of the school at the top left corner which is decorated with different color on the name **Moringa School** On the top right there is a navigation bar to take you through the page with ease. The page contains the mission of the school and stories about it like: orientation, board meeting, graduation party, technical members and some of the projects done at the school. The page also offers alot of information through the button links in pink. Visitors can also enroll for coursess directly from the page. Finally you can get any support from the Moringa team through the contact us link.
